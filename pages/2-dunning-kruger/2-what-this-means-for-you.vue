    <h3>What this means for you</h3>
    <p>The DKE is going to turn up every day in every professional environment you experience for the rest of your life. You will run into self-deprecating geniuses, as well as horribly incompetent people oblivious to the disasters they are creating. You can't fix them, but you can be aware of the situation and compensate:</p>
    <h4>1. Be humble, but don't take any shit</h4>
    <p>The problem with the DKE is that there's no way to know, without some kind of external, objective measurement, how good you really are, and therefore what quartile you are in. As the diagram below illustrates, people who are extremely inexperienced (bottom quartile) are extremely confident, even more so than top-quartile, maximally-experienced people. So if you feel like you're pretty good at a task, you're either really excellent at it or really terrible at it, there's no way to know.</p>

    <p>The problem with getting external validation from your peers is also part of the DKE: they are also subject to the DKE. So they also have no idea how good they are, and might be radically over or under-estimating you. They might also be subject to other kinds of bias that would make them over or under-estimate your skill, such as racist or sexist bias (both of which can work either way, depending on the races and genders involved).</p>
    <p>Since there's no real way to know how good you are at anything: be humble. But if somebody says you're terrible, be wary: they might just be an idiot.</p>

    <h4>2. Look for mentors</h4>
    <p>You can't get out of a bottom-quartile trough on your own; in fact, you won't even know you're in one. The only way to get out of it is to have somebody genuinely competent drag you out of it. This is a huge advantage of mentorship: an external, relatively objective outsider to tell you when you are really and truly terrible at things.</p>

    <h4>3. Don't let your competence steer you into danger</h4>
    <p>This is a corollary of the quartiles being independent. Do not let your competence in one field fool you into believing you are generically "smart" and do anything anywhere. If you're smart, you may be able to <i>learn</i> anything, but if you are bottom quartile at a task you may never be able to figure it out on your own. Even the very smartest people need some help getting started.</p>
