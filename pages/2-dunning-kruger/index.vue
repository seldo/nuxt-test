    <h1>The Dunning-Kruger effect</h1>
    <h2>People are bad at knowing things.</h2>
    <p>Before you start learning anything, it's important to understand the Dunning-Kruger effect and how it affects you and the people around you.</p>
    <p>Dunning and Kruger were psychologists who in 1999 released a paper called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367">Unskilled and Unaware of it</a>. The phenomenon described in that paper is what is now called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. The DKE is about how good you are at a task, measured objectively, versus how good you <i>think</i> you are at that task.</p>
    <p>Dunning and Kruger gave students a bunch of common, repeatable, measurable tasks in things like logic, memory, grammar and math: things where you can objectively measure someone's competence. Then they got those students to rank themselves relative to their classmates. Then they divided the groups into four quartiles, based on their objectively measured competence: the top quartile were objectively good at things, the bottom quartile objectively terrible. They found 3 important findings:</p>
    
    <h3>1. The top quartile under-estimate their competence</h3>
    <p>People who are very good at a specific task believe they are about average at that task. This is probably because to them the task seems "easy", so they aren't trying very hard. They also over-estimate how good their classmates are, again because it seems "easy" - it's easy, therefore most people must be pretty good at it.</p>
    <p>This effect is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. Impostor syndrome can be a real problem for competent people, but it is especially dangerous to those from under-represented groups in technology. If you are already pre-disposed to believe that you are merely average when you are excellent, you are vulnerable to those who, for reasons of personal prejudice, are likely to dismiss your accomplishments. These people are assholes, and it's important for you to ignore them.
    
    <h3>2. The bottom quartile over-estimate their competence</h3>
    <p>People who are, objectively speaking, the worst at a task tend to over-estimate their competence. In fact they tend to rate themselves as not average but above-average, which is nice for their self-esteem but bad in every other possible way.</p>
    <p>In addition to over-estimating how good they are, bottom quartile people are very bad at estimating how good everybody else is. They neither over-estimate nor under-estimate those people: instead, they are basically just a random number generator.</p>
    <p>The reason for this is <b>bottom quartile people don't know what good and bad even look like</b>. They don't know they're bad, they don't know other people are good, they are just too incompetent to have any idea what's going on. This is especially problematic because it means <b>they never get any better</b> on their own: you cannot improve if you don't know what "better" looks like. They have no feedback loop to learn from.</p>
    <p>The good news for these people is that <b>focused mentoring can help</b>. Given an outside source of information to tell them what is good and bad, they will slowly improve. Once they get out of the bottom quartile, they have enough of a feedback loop to be able to further improve on their own.</p>
    
    <h3>3. The quartiles are independent</h3>
    <p>Your quartile in any one task is independent of your quartile in any other. Being very good at math does not automatically make you good at grammar. Having a good memory does not make you good at logic. This is true across the board of all skills: being a good programmer does not make you good at people management. Being good at algorithms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">does not make you an economist</a>.</p>
  
    <h3>What this means for you</h3>
    <p>The DKE is going to turn up every day in every professional environment you experience for the rest of your life. You will run into self-deprecating geniuses, as well as horribly incompetent people oblivious to the disasters they are creating. You can't fix them, but you can be aware of the situation and compensate:</p>
    <h4>1. Be humble, but don't take any shit</h4>
    <p>The problem with the DKE is that there's no way to know, without some kind of external, objective measurement, how good you really are, and therefore what quartile you are in. As the diagram below illustrates, people who are extremely inexperienced (bottom quartile) are extremely confident, even more so than top-quartile, maximally-experienced people. So if you feel like you're pretty good at a task, you're either really excellent at it or really terrible at it, there's no way to know.</p>
    <div class="diagram"><img src="/images/dunning-kruger-effect.png"></div>
    <p>The problem with getting external validation from your peers is also part of the DKE: they are also subject to the DKE. So they also have no idea how good they are, and might be radically over or under-estimating you. They might also be subject to other kinds of bias that would make them over or under-estimate your skill, such as racist or sexist bias (both of which can work either way, depending on the races and genders involved).</p>
    <p>Since there's no real way to know how good you are at anything: be humble. But if somebody says you're terrible, be wary: they might just be an idiot.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Look for mentors</h4>
    <p>You can't get out of a bottom-quartile trough on your own; in fact, you won't even know you're in one. The only way to get out of it is to have somebody genuinely competent drag you out of it. This is a huge advantage of mentorship: an external, relatively objective outsider to tell you when you are really and truly terrible at things.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Don't let your competence steer you into danger</h4>
    <p>This is a corollary of the quartiles being independent. Do not let your competence in one field fool you into believing you are generically "smart" and do anything anywhere. If you're smart, you may be able to <i>learn</i> anything, but if you are bottom quartile at a task you may never be able to figure it out on your own. Even the very smartest people need some help getting started.</p>
