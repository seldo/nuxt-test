    <h1>The Dunning-Kruger effect</h1>
    <h2>People are bad at knowing things.</h2>
    <p>Before you start learning anything, it's important to understand the Dunning-Kruger effect and how it affects you and the people around you.</p>
    <p>Dunning and Kruger were psychologists who in 1999 released a paper called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367">Unskilled and Unaware of it</a>. The phenomenon described in that paper is what is now called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. The DKE is about how good you are at a task, measured objectively, versus how good you <i>think</i> you are at that task.</p>
    <p>Dunning and Kruger gave students a bunch of common, repeatable, measurable tasks in things like logic, memory, grammar and math: things where you can objectively measure someone's competence. Then they got those students to rank themselves relative to their classmates. Then they divided the groups into four quartiles, based on their objectively measured competence: the top quartile were objectively good at things, the bottom quartile objectively terrible. They found 3 important findings:</p>

    <h3>1. The top quartile under-estimate their competence</h3>
    <p>People who are very good at a specific task believe they are about average at that task. This is probably because to them the task seems "easy", so they aren't trying very hard. They also over-estimate how good their classmates are, again because it seems "easy" - it's easy, therefore most people must be pretty good at it.</p>
    <p>This effect is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. Impostor syndrome can be a real problem for competent people, but it is especially dangerous to those from under-represented groups in technology. If you are already pre-disposed to believe that you are merely average when you are excellent, you are vulnerable to those who, for reasons of personal prejudice, are likely to dismiss your accomplishments. These people are assholes, and it's important for you to ignore them.

    <h3>2. The bottom quartile over-estimate their competence</h3>
    <p>People who are, objectively speaking, the worst at a task tend to over-estimate their competence. In fact they tend to rate themselves as not average but above-average, which is nice for their self-esteem but bad in every other possible way.</p>
    <p>In addition to over-estimating how good they are, bottom quartile people are very bad at estimating how good everybody else is. They neither over-estimate nor under-estimate those people: instead, they are basically just a random number generator.</p>
    <p>The reason for this is <b>bottom quartile people don't know what good and bad even look like</b>. They don't know they're bad, they don't know other people are good, they are just too incompetent to have any idea what's going on. This is especially problematic because it means <b>they never get any better</b> on their own: you cannot improve if you don't know what "better" looks like. They have no feedback loop to learn from.</p>
    <p>The good news for these people is that <b>focused mentoring can help</b>. Given an outside source of information to tell them what is good and bad, they will slowly improve. Once they get out of the bottom quartile, they have enough of a feedback loop to be able to further improve on their own.</p>

    <h3>3. The quartiles are independent</h3>
    <p>Your quartile in any one task is independent of your quartile in any other. Being very good at math does not automatically make you good at grammar. Having a good memory does not make you good at logic. This is true across the board of all skills: being a good programmer does not make you good at people management. Being good at algorithms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">does not make you an economist</a>.</p>
