      <h2>The Short Version</h2>
      <p>I give a talk about web development, usually to coding bootcamps. If you like watching videos, you can see a recent recording of it here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIJZnF_L5KI&t=4s">Stuff Everybody Knows, part 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H8VTCSbYQg&t=35s">Stuff Everybody Knows, part 2</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have a lot more material than can reasonably fit into even that very long format of the talk, and websites have the potential to reach way more people than a talk. So I am slowly converting the content of the talk into a website.</p>
      <p>If you're a web developer at any level of experience, you should find this useful. If you don't, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/seldo">complain to me</a>.</p>
