    <h2>3: Use the command line</h2>
    <p>Unix has its fans and its detractors. Some people use Unix-based operating systems like MacOS every day, others prefer Windows. Whatever your personal preference, it doesn't matter: you will almost certainly be deploying your software to a Linux box. The sooner you accept this and <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/">get really good at using Linux</a>, the sooner you will graduate to the next level of efficiency as a working programmer.</p>
    <h3>The unreasonable effectiveness of Bash</h3>
    <p>The standard scripting language in most Unix operating systems is Bash. An old, weird, half-baked Swiss Army Knife of a programming language, Bash is nonetheless ubiquitous and hugely effective at writing very short scripts that automate command line tasks. And, per the previous section, you should be automating far more than you probably are. To do it, you should learn bash.</p>
    <p>Tasks that for some developers would be 10 minutes of typing with a bunch of tedious copying and pasting are, for people truly comfortable with bash, the work of 30 seconds of thinking very hard. If that doesn't sound like a gigantic time saving, think how often you might need to do that task and then check the table at the top of the page again.</p>
    <h3>But not just Bash</h3>
    <p>All Unix operating systems have a bunch of standard utilities that are (mostly) the same regardless of the flavor, and they are very powerful indeed. <kbd>grep</kbd>, <kbd>find</kbd>, <kbd>awk</kbd>, <kbd>sed</kbd> and other fundamental Unix utilities will save you unreasonably huge amounts of time if you take the time to learn them and use them judiciously.</p>
