    <h1>Basic Programming Skills</h1>

    <p>Before you get started with programming in any language, there are a collection of meta-skills that every programmer needs. These skills are so fundamental that experienced programmers are often unconscious of the fact that they have these skills and took years acquiring them. As a result, they don't think to mention to new programmers that they should focus on these things first. As usual, I'm here to fix that.</p>

    <h2>There's no such thing as a 10x programmer</h2>
    <p>There is a persistent myth in tech of the "10x programmer", mythical individuals who are ten times as fast as a normal programmer and should be over-paid and allowed to get away with being anti-social assholes. Firstly, the effect on team morale of employing an asshole will always outweigh any productivity benefit they might bring. Secondly, such people don't exist.</p>
    <p>Everybody programs at about the same speed. What does exist are programmers who <b>get a lot more programming done</b>, and the way that they do it is by eliminating all of the grunt work and repetitive tasks in their programming lives. They get effortlessly fast at their tools. They type fast, edit quickly, and merge and branch as easily as breathing. They slow down <b>only to solve hard problems</b>, and as a result they go much, much faster than programmers who do not master these basic skills.</p>
