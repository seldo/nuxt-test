    <h2>5: Become effortless at version control</h2>
    <p>Another foundational skill that you should become fluent with is version control, and by that I mean <a href="https://try.github.io/">git</a>. There are lots of types of version control management software, but luckily that doesn't matter because everybody uses git.</p>
    <p>Git is essential to how software is put together these days. It's how teams of more than one person collaborate on code, it's how you find and correct mistakes, it's often central to how you deploy the software too.</p>
    <p>So get really, really good at git. Go beyond <kbd>clone</kbd> and <kbd>checkout</kbd>. Learn how to branch, and merge, and squash, and rebase. Get so good at it that it's effortless, because you are going to be doing it hundreds of times a day, and those seconds add up quickly.</p>
