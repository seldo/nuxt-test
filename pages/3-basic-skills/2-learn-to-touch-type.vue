    <h2>2: Learn to touch type</h2>
    <p>Can you type with all 10 fingers, without needing to look at the keyboard? If not, stop everything you are doing and learn, because it is wasting you an absolutely staggering amount of time.</p>
    <p>There's no shame in being unable to touch type. My school didn't offer typing classes, and I didn't get around to learning to type properly until I was in my mid-20s. It took me 15 minutes a night for a couple of months, and the result was a staggering increase in productivity.</p>
    <p>Let's do some simple math: assume you type at 35 words per minute, which is pretty average for an untrained, 2- or 4-finger typist. Assume you spend 8 hours a day typing, which whether you are programming or talking to people on Slack or sending emails is not an unreasonable expectation for a working programmer. Now assume by learning to touch type you get a little faster -- 40 words per minute (a pretty good typist does more like 65wpm, but let's be conservative). This would save you an hour a day!</p>
    <p>Over the course of a year you would save <b>1.5 working months</b>. So if you were bootstrapping your startup and you knew you had enough money to work for 12 months, you could spend the first month doing <i>nothing but learning to type faster</i> and you would <b>still</b> end up getting more done.</p>
    <p>I can't emphasize it enough: your whole job is typing, whether it's code or words. Get as fast at it as you possibly can.</p>
