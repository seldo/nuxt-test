    <h2>6: Practice communication</h2>
    <h3>Your job is 50% solving the problem, 50% communicating about the problem.</h3>
    <p>An unexamined belief that a lot of developers have is that the hard part of being a programmer, in fact the only important part, is being able to solve complicated technical problems. This is a disastrous misunderstanding of the job.</p>
    <p>Generously 50% of your job is solving the problem; the other 50% is figuring out what the problem was in the first place, and letting people know how you solved it. Without fluent, accurate communication with your bosses, reports, clients and co-workers, you may find yourself solving technical problems, but they will not be the right problems, or the solutions may be inappropriate, and all your technical expertise will be wasted.</p>
    <p>Anyone, given enough time, can program a solution to a given technical problem. But to be a good working programmer, you need to have a view of the wider picture in the team and the company in which you operate. All technical problems have technical constraints -- disk, memory, processor -- but there are also organizational constraints, which if ignored will make your solutions worthless. How much time do you have to solve the problem? How expensive can the solution be? Who will be using it? What other systems are likely to be affected by my work? Being unable to answer these questions is the hallmark of a junior developer.</p>

    <p>Once you've mastered all of the above, you can get on to learning actual web development.</p>
