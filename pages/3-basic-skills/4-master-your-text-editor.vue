    <h2>4: Master your text editor</h2>
    <p>Another thing to be absolutely great at is your text editor. The world is full of people who will tell you that you should use vim or emacs and that anybody who doesn't use one of those two editors is not a Real Programmerâ„¢ and I am here to dispel that advice as being weapons-grade bullshit.</p>
    <p>The fact of the matter is <b>it doesn't matter what editor you use, as long as you get really good at using it</b>. And the proof of this principle is the fact that many professional programmers are incredibly productive using vim, a piece of software that was garbage when it was released 26 years ago and is still garbage today. Vim fans are huge proponents of the idea that learning keyboard shortcuts is much faster than using the mouse, when in fact decades of research show that <a href="https://danluu.com/keyboard-v-mouse/">using a mouse is consistently faster than using a keyboard</a>. For the record, emacs is also garbage.</p>
    <p>You know why people who use Vim are so productive with it? Because they have been using it for 26 years. If you consistently use the same piece of software for 26 years, you will be amazingly good and fast at using it, and it doesn't matter that it's a piece of shit that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/">you have to Google how to quit</a>.</p>
    <p>So: pick an editor. It does not matter even a little bit which one. Then use it consistently and constantly. Don't switch editors every week, don't constantly rearrange UI and remap shortcuts. Just find one you like and stick with it forever, so that using it is like breathing.</p>
